---

A custom, image-centric theme for Gatsby. Made for publishers and portfolios with plenty of graphics to show off to the world. Fully responsive, with light and dark mode, released under the MIT license.

**Based on [London After Midnight](https://github.com/vaporwavy/gatsby-london-after-midnight) for Gatsby** which is based on [London](https://github.com/ImedAdel/gatsby-london) for Gatsby.

### What is different from London After Midnight?
* light-mode and dark-mode compabible, dark-mode as default for older systems
* Removed Google Fonts, using system fonts instead (for speed and privacy :)
* Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) in stead of plain CSS.

_First time with Gatsby? Take a look on the [official and community-created starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/)._

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new project

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-awesome-portfolio https://github.com/jooplaan/gatsby-london-night-and-day
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-awesome-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
